# FE-RWD
Florida Energy Systems Consortium Responsive Web Design Project
HW01: Put together a proposal for the responsive redesign of http://floridaenergy.ufl.edu
HW02: gh-page - https://alanportugal.github.io/FE-RWD/
HW07: Google Chart Library Used - Bar Charts
      https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/barchart
      google.charts.load('current', {'packages':['corechart', 'bar']});

      Reason for using Bar Charts:
      Both sets of data had a numerical unit of measurement listed for an annual period over many years. I think a vertical bar chart that starts from the oldest date on the left and sequentially advances per year to the right - would best communicate to a person viewing the data how things have progressed over time.
